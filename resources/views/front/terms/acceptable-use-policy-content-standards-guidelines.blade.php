            provisions of this policy or our website terms of use <a href="{{ route('terms.of.use') }}">SITE'S TERMS OF
                USE</a>.</p>
        <p>Not to access without authority, interfere with, damage or disrupt:</p>
        <p>any part of our site;</p>
        <p>any equipment or network on which our site is stored;</p>
        <p>any software used in the provision of our site; or</p>
        <p>any equipment or network or software owned or used by any third party.</p>
        <p>Interactive services</p>
        <p>We may from time to time provide interactive services on our site, including, without limitation:</p>
        <p>Video-sharing facilities.</p>
        <p>Chat messages and rooms.</p>
        <p>Bulletin boards.</p>
        <p>Chat Bots.</p>
        <p>Quizzes.</p>
        <p>Games to earn rewards and points.</p>
        <p>Loyalty Incentives.</p>
        <p>(interactive services.)</p>
        <p>Where we do provide any interactive service, we will provide clear information to you about the
            kind of service offered, if it is moderated and what form of moderation is used (including whether it is
            human or technical).</p>
        <p>We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users (and in particular, for children) from
            third parties when they use any interactive service provided on our site, and we will decide in each case
            whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant service (including what kind of moderation to
            use) in the light of those risks. However, we are under no obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any
            interactive service we provide on our site, and we expressly exclude our liability for any loss or damage
            arising from the use of any interactive service by a user in contravention of our content standards, whether
            the service is moderated or not.</p>
        <p>The use of any of our interactive services by a minor is subject to the consent of their parent or
            guardian. We advise parents who permit their children to use an interactive service that it is important
            that they communicate with their children about their safety online, as moderation is not fool proof. Minors
            who are using any interactive service should be made aware of the potential risks to them.</p>
        <p>Where we do moderate an interactive service, we will normally provide you with a means of
            contacting the moderator, should a concern or difficulty arise.</p>
        <p>We do not store terrorist content.</p>
        <p>Content standards</p>
        <p>These content standards apply to any and all material which you contribute to our site
            (Contribution), and to any interactive services associated with it.</p>
