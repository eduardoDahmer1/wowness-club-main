        <p>Marketing</p>
        <p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and
            advertising.</p>
        <p>Promotional offers from us</p>
        <p>We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may
            want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers
            may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).</p>
        <p>You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased
            goods or services from us and you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.</p>
        <p>Third-party marketing</p>
        <p>We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing
            purposes.</p>
        <p><strong>Opting out</strong></p>
        <p>You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by contacting us at any
            time.</p>
        <p>Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us
            as a result of a product/service purchase, warranty registration, product/service experience or other
            transactions.</p>
        <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
        <p>You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access
            cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become

        <p><strong>Change of purpose</strong></p>
        <p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider
            that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you
            wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original
            purpose, please contact us.</p>
        <p>If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the
            legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>
        <p>Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the
            above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>
        <p id="sectiondisclousures">Disclosures of your personal data</p>

        <p>Specific third parties such as <a href="#thirdparties">SPECIFIC THIRD PARTIES</a>.</p>
        <p>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets.
            Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our
            business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.
        </p>
        <p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with
            the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes
            and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our
            instructions.</p>
        <p id="sectiontransfers">International transfers</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Some of our external third parties are based outside the UK so their processing of your personal data will
            involve a transfer of data outside the UK.</p>
        <p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the UK, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded
            to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
        <p>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of
            protection for personal data.</p>
        <p>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved for use in the UK which give
            personal data the same protection it has in the UK.</p>
        <p>Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your
            personal data out of the UK.</p>
        <p>Data security</p>
        <p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally
            lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your
            personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to
            know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of
            confidentiality.</p>
        <p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any
            applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
        <p>Data retention</p>
        <p>How long will you use my personal data for?</p>
        <p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes we
            collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or
            reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or
            if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.</p>
        <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and
            sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your
            personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those
            purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.

        <p id="sectionretention">Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available
            in our data retention

            for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further
            notice to you.</p>
        <p>Your legal rights</p>
        <p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data,

            <li><strong>No fee usually required</strong></li>
            <li>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).
                However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
                Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</li>
            <li><strong>What we may need from you</strong></li>
            <li>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your
                right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure
                to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also
                contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Time limit to respond</strong></li>
            <li>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than
                a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we
                will notify you and keep you updated.</li>

        <p id="sectionglossari">Glossary</p>
        <p>LAWFUL BASIS</p>
        <p>Legitimate Interest means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us
            to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and
            balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your
            personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our
            interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or
            permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests
            against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.</p>
        <p>Performance of Contract means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to
            which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.</p>
        <p>Comply with a legal obligation means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with
            a legal obligation that we are subject to.</p>
        <p>THIRD PARTIES</p>
        <p>External Third Parties</p>
        <p>Service providers acting as processors based in Brazil who provide IT and system administration services.</p>
        <p>Professional advisers acting as processors or joint controllers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and
            insurers based in the United Kingdom and Mexico who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and
            accounting services.</p>
        <p>HM Revenue & Customs, regulators and other authorities acting as processors or joint controllers based in the
            United Kingdom who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.</p>
        <p id="sectionlegalrights">YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</p>
        <p>You have the right to:</p>
        <p>Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to
            receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
        <p>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or
            inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you
            provide to us.</p>
        <p>Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal
            data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to
            delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing
            (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your
            personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your
            request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of
            your request.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those
            of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to
            processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the
            right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we
            may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your
            rights and freedoms.</p>
        <p>Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the
            processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.</p>
        <p>Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</p>
        <p>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish,
            exercise or defend legal claims.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding
            legitimate grounds to use it.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or
            a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
            Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to
            use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data.
            However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.
            If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will
            advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
