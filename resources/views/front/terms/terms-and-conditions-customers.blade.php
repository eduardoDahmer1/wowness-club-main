        <p><strong>7. How contracts are formed between you and Practitioners</strong></p>

            agent of the Practitioner) issue an email acknowledgement of order. The contract between you and a
            Practitioner will relate only to those goods and/or services notified in the email acknowledgement of order.
        </p>
        <p><strong>8. Payment methods</strong></p>
        <p>Purchases for goods and/or services you make with Practitioners may only be paid for using the

                href="#stripe">Stripe></a>
            ("Payment
            Provider"). <span>&nbsp; </span>In accepting or otherwise processing your
            payments related to the purchase of items from Practitioners, we act in the capacity of commercial agent of
            the Practitioner. In respect of all payment methods, the Practitioner acknowledges and agrees that the valid
            payment by you to us for the purchase of services between you and the Practitioner will satisfy your
            obligation to pay the Practitioner for the relevant item(s) and consequently, any debt obligations owed by
            you to the Practitioner for the purchase of such items shall be extinguished at that time. You acknowledge
            that these Customer Terms, and/or any transaction made by you via Wowness Club, do not create or imply any
            partnership, joint venture or trust relationship between us, you and/or the Practitioner. The Practitioner
            further agrees that it will not seek recourse (legal or otherwise) against you for payment of items if you
            have validly paid us. All prices shall be shown in the applicable currency and payable in that currency. You
            accept that some banks may charge you an additional fee for certain transactions (for example, international
            transactions). You accept that item prices in the currencies displayed do not vary according to your
            location; delivery charges will vary depending on the destination to choose to have the item delivered. All
            prices shown on the Website are inclusive of VAT or other sales taxes due in the United Kingdom or the EU.
            &nbsp;For delivery destinations outside of the United Kingdom, prices do not include other customs duties
            which will, if applicable, be payable by you.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>9. Refusal of transaction</strong></p>
        <p>We may refuse to process a transaction for any reason or refuse service to anyone at any time at
            our sole discretion. We will not be liable to you or any third party by reason of so refusing or by reason
            of unwinding or suspending any transaction after processing has begun.</p>
        <p><strong>10. Availability<span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p>Your shopping basket on the Website displays the goods you have chosen, the Practitioner who shall
            provide them and details of availability. Some services, especially, individual sessions, but not limited
            to, might require you to schedule and confirm your slots directly with the practitioner. Either via a
            booking link or via phone. It is your responsibility to read any after-purchase instructions provided by the
            practitioner regarding how you can schedule and confirm these services. The availability for each
            Practitioner varies, please read the description on the relevant service page to learn more.</p>

            them directly.</p>

            these Customer Terms, or if we fail to exercise any of the rights or remedies to which we are entitled under
            them, this shall not constitute a waiver of such rights or remedies and shall not relieve you from
