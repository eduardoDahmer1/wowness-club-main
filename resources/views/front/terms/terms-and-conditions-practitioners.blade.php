        <p>1. Introduction</p>
        <p><strong>About us</strong>. Wowness Club Limited ("<strong>we</strong>") provide a booking platform
            on which practitioners ("<strong>you</strong>") can advertise the holistic health and wellness services,
            events, and experiences you offer to a wider range of potential customers.<span>&nbsp; </span>We are a
            limited company registered in England and Wales
            under company number 14185864 and have our registered office at 167-169 Great Portland Street, 5th Floor,
            London, England, W1W 5PF.</p>
        <p><strong>Agreement. <span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p>These terms and conditions ("<strong>Conditions</strong>"), and the other documents that we refer
            to below and on our Website, set out the legally binding agreement ("Agreement") between you and us which
            applies when you sell Practitioner Services via the Website.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>It is important that you read and understand these Conditions before agreeing to them. <span>&nbsp;</span>
        </p>
        <p>Definitions that apply to these Conditions are set out in the main body of these Conditions and in
            clause 17 (Definitions and Interpretation).</p>
        <p><strong>Updates to the Agreement</strong>. We may update the Agreement (including the Fees) from
            time to time. We will notify you by email of any proposed changes. Except in the limited situations
            described in clause 1.5 below, the proposed changes will not apply until at least 15 (fifteen) days from and
            including the date on which we notify you about them (and we will set out the date that the changes will
            apply from in the relevant notification). If a proposed change(s) means that you then need to make technical
            or commercial adjustments in order to comply with it, we will always give you a longer notice period before
            the change(s) apply.</p>
        <p><strong>Right to terminate if you don't agree to an update to the Agreement</strong>.<span>&nbsp;
            </span>Whenever we notify you of a proposed change to the
            Agreement, you will have the right to terminate the Agreement before the expiry of the applicable notice
            period. If you do wish to terminate and let us know during the applicable notice period, the termination
            will then take effect 15 (fifteen) days from your receipt of the notification. You will give up your right
            to terminate if you take clear action which indicates you wish to continue the Agreement with the proposed
            changes. For example, submitting new Practitioner Services during the notice period will be considered by us
            as clear affirmative action that you wish to give up your termination right. Please see clause 2.4 below for
            more information on the effects of termination.</p>
        <p><strong>When the notice period does not apply</strong>.<span>&nbsp;
            </span>The minimum 15 (fifteen) day notice period in clause 1.3 above will not apply where:</p>
        <p>we are subject to a legal or regulatory obligation that requires us to change the Agreement in a
            way that does not allow us to give you that length of notice period; and</p>
        <p>we need to change the Agreement to address an unforeseen and imminent danger that relates to
            defending the Wowness Club Service, the Website, Customers or Practitioners from fraud, malware, spam, data
            breaches or other cybersecurity risks.</p>
        <p>Term and Termination<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><strong>Term</strong>. The Agreement applies throughout the period of our provision of the Wowness
            Club Service to you ("<strong>Term</strong>").<span>&nbsp; </span>The Term
            will start after:</p>
        <p>we have received from you an Application Form completed to our satisfaction and the documents
            outlined in clause 4.1.2 and 4.1.3; and</p>
        <p>we have notified you in writing of our acceptance of your Application Form and the documents
            outlined in clause 4.1.2 and 4.1.3. It will be entirely at our discretion whether we accept your Application
            Form; and</p>
        <p>you have paid the Subscription Fee, if applicable.</p>
        <p>The Term will continue until terminated as set out in these Conditions.</p>
        <p><strong>Mutual right to terminate</strong>. We both have the right to terminate the Agreement by
            simply giving the other party at least 30 (thirty) days' written notice.</p>
        <p><strong>Restriction, suspension or termination by us</strong>. We may restrict, suspend or
            terminate our provision of the Wowness Club Service (or any part of it), or terminate the Agreement if:</p>
        <p>you significantly breach the Agreement (including a significant breach of any of the Policies);
        </p>
        <p>we have the right to do so, as set out in the rest of the Agreement, and we validly exercise that
            right;</p>
        <p>you fail to pay any Fees payable to us within 7 (seven) Working Days of their due date for
            payment;</p>
        <p>you don't use the Wowness Club Service for a period of 90 (ninety) days or more;</p>
        <p>if you don&rsquo;t have enough money to pay your debts when they fall due, or you enter into a
            legal process or an arrangement relating to being unable to pay your debts;</p>
        <p>in our sole discretion, we determine that your eligibility or suitability to be listed on the
            Website, or to receive the Wowness Club Service, changes.</p>
        <p><strong>Exercising our right to restrict, suspend or terminate.</strong></p>
        <p>If we restrict or suspend our provision of the Wowness Club Service (or any part of it), we will
            provide you with a clear explanation of our reasons for doing so (including referencing any specific
            relevant facts and circumstances, along with the applicable grounds we're relying on to do so) by email on
            or before the date on which the restriction or suspension becomes effective, in order to give you the
            opportunity to clarify the facts and circumstances.</p>
        <p>If we terminate the provision of the Wowness Club Service to you or the Agreement, we will provide
            you with a statement setting out our reasons for that decision (including referencing any specific relevant
            facts and circumstances, along with the applicable grounds we're relying on to do so) by email at least 15
            (fifteen) days' before termination takes effect, except where:</p>
        <p>we are obliged by a legal or regulatory obligation to terminate the provision of the Wowness Club
            Service or the Agreement; or</p>
        <p>you have repeatedly infringed your obligations under the Agreement,</p>
        <p>in which case we will provide you reasonable notice in the circumstances (if we can) and the
            statement of reasons for that decision by email as soon as reasonably possible).</p>
        <p><strong>What happens when the Wowness Club Service or Agreement is suspended or
                terminated</strong>.<span>&nbsp; </span>If the Wowness Club Service or our
            Agreement is suspended or terminated:</p>
        <p>you must pay us all Fees due up to and including the date of suspension or termination;</p>
        <p>you will remain liable to pay any outstanding refunds to Customers and associated Refund Fees (as
            detailed below) following suspension or termination;</p>
        <p>we will not keep copies of any information provided or generated by you following the termination
            of the Agreement. If you need access to the information you have generated, you are responsible for keeping
            your own copies and we suggest that you should download such information during any notice period prior to
            suspension or termination;</p>
        <p>your Profile Page will be hidden from Customers and/or will show as unverified, but you will
            continue to have access to the DashBoard for 30 days in order to pay any outstanding Fees and download
            information in accordance with clause 2.5.3 above; and</p>
        <p>termination of this Agreement doesn't affect any of our or your rights or liabilities, and doesn't
            affect any provision set out in the Agreement which is expressly or by implication intended to come into
            force or continue in force after termination.</p>
        <p>The Wowness Club Service</p>
        <p><strong>Provision of the Wowness Club Service</strong>.<span>&nbsp;
            </span>Following the start of the Term, we will:</p>
        <p>provide you with a password so that you can set up your Profile Page and, once we&rsquo;ve made
            the functions available to you, update your Profile Page;</p>
        <p>provide the Wowness Club Service with reasonable skill and care; and</p>
        <p>use reasonable efforts to restore any faults in the Wowness Club Service as soon as reasonably
            possible. As you will appreciate, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure,
            there is always a risk that communications by electronic means may not reach their intended destination, or
            may do so much later than intended, for reasons outside of our control, and that it is technically
            impossible to provide the Wowness Club Service entirely free of fault at all times.</p>
        <p><strong>Changes to the Wowness Club Service</strong>. We reserve the right to revise or alter the
            Wowness Club Service. Any variation in the Wowness Club Service will be subject to these Conditions.</p>
        <p><strong>The Platform</strong>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Website
            provides a platform to allow you to offer and sell your Practitioner Services directly to Customers. In
            doing so, you authorise and appoint us as your commercial agent to directly negotiate and/or conclude the
            sale and/or purchase of Practitioner Services between you and Customers via the Wowness Club Service and we
            accept this appointment in accordance with these Conditions. As part of this process:</p>
        <p>any contract to sell and buy Practitioner Services is made only between you and the Customer
            concerned and we are not a party to any such contract;</p>
        <p>we facilitate the negotiation of the sale of Practitioner Services between you and Customers
            through the use of the Dashboard and e-mail communication services operated and managed by us, together with
            the Wowness Club Service, which contribute to increasing your goodwill, promote your Practitioner Services
            and generally encourage Customers to place orders with you; and</p>
        <p>products and services offered for sale through the Website are neither owned by us nor come into
            our possession at any time.</p>
        <p><strong>Customer Feedback</strong>.<span>&nbsp; </span>We use a
            third-party service provider to provide Customer Feedback ("<strong>Customer Feedback Agent</strong>"). By
            using the Website and the Wowness Club Service you agree that:</p>
        <p>we and/or the Customer Feedback Agent may, at our/their discretion, post on your relevant Service
            Page and on the Customer Feedback Agent's website any and all Customer Feedback relating to a transaction
            for a period of up to two (2) years after we and/or the Customer Feedback Agent receives that Customer
            Feedback;</p>
        <p>following the provision of any Customer Feedback, we will make the Customer Feedback available to
            you via the Dashboard.<span>&nbsp; </span>You may submit a Response to any
            negative Customer Feedback via the facility provided by us on the Dashboard within 5 days of receipt of the
            negative Customer Feedback, and we and any Customer Feedback Agent will display any Response with reasonable
            prominence and proximity to the corresponding Customer Feedback, which may be posted on the Website and on
            the Customer Feedback Agent's website after 5 days have passed following receipt of the negative Customer
            Feedback. You agree that you will not contact any Customer directly, whether via the Dashboard, through an
            order or service enquiry or otherwise in response to any Customer Feedback;</p>
        <p>you agree that you will ensure that any Response is true and accurate and not misleading in any
            way, and does not contain any material that may be construed as offensive, defamatory, or unlawful; and</p>
        <p>we may, in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions of the Customer Feedback Agent,
            elect to amend, or not to post, any Response that we and/or the Customer Feedback Agent consider, in
            our/their sole discretion, to be offensive, defamatory, unlawful or otherwise inappropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Introductions to other parties</strong>.<span>&nbsp;
            </span>We may from time to time introduce you to third parties with whom special terms have been arranged
            unique to our Practitioners.<span>&nbsp; </span>Any contract entered into
            between you and any such third party is concluded directly between you and the third party concerned and,
            except as expressly set out in these Conditions, we cannot be involved in the fulfilment or liability for
            any such contracts. We will let you know if we benefit from any special terms with such third parties.</p>

        <p>You:</p>
        <p>are responsible for the security and proper use of all passwords, or other security devices used
            in connection with the provision of the Wowness Club Service and access to the Profile Page and Dashboard
            (which includes changing passwords on a regular basis);</p>
        <p>will take all necessary steps to ensure that passwords and other security devices remain
            confidential, secure, used properly and not disclosed to unauthorised third parties;</p>
        <p>will inform us immediately if there is any reason to believe that a password or any other security

        <p>will inform us immediately if you forget or lose a password and must satisfy such security checks

        <p>will ensure that the Dashboard and its content remain entirely confidential, and that no other
            person beside those in your employment has sight of the Dashboard or any of its content.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right:</p>
        <p>to suspend access to the Wowness Club Service if at any time we consider that there is or is
            likely to be a breach of security, in which event we will notify you of any steps to be taken by you as soon
            as possible; and</p>
        <p>to require you to change (or to ourselves change, and then notify you) any or all of the passwords

            steps to be taken by you as soon as possible.</p>
        <p><strong>Your Profile Page <span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p>We have absolute discretion as to:</p>
        <p>the look, feel and content of the Website (including all Profile Pages);</p>
        <p>the inclusion, positioning, content, location and all other presentation of Practitioner
            Information (including in our sole discretion the right to remove any Practitioner Information from the
            Website at any time during the Term); and</p>
        <p>the Practitioner Services set live on the Website (including in our sole discretion the right to
            remove any Practitioner Service from the Website in line with one or more of our Policies, or not allow a
            Practitioner Service to be set live for sale on the Website).</p>
        <p>You agree at all times to comply with all Policies as updated by us from time to time.</p>
        <p>You agree not to review, nor engage any third party to review, Practitioner Services appearing on
            your Profile Page. This prohibition includes, without limitation, paying for reviews or any other means of
            artificially increasing the number of reviews of Practitioner Services on your Profile Page.</p>
        <p>Each Profile Page contains up to 30 (thirty) listings as standard but that number can be extended
            at our sole discretion. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>Ownership of your Profile Page (including any transfer of ownership as a result of the sale of
            your business e.g. a sale of more than 50% of the shares in your business or a sale of substantially all the
            assets of your business) may only be transferred with our prior written agreement.<span>&nbsp; </span>You
            must give us at least 30 days written notice of any
            transfer of ownership and you agree to provide us with the information set out in clause 4.1.2 and 4.1.3
            above in relation to the new Practitioner or new owner of your business. We will suspend the Profile Page
            while we verify the new Practitioner's or new owner's details, which shall include checking their
            eligibility and suitability to be listed on the Website.<span>&nbsp;
            </span>Where applicable, we will only provide access to the Wowness Club Service to a new Practitioner once
            they have agreed to enter into an agreement incorporating these Conditions.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Profile
            Page will be suspended until all payments owed
            to you, the outgoing Practitioner, have been cleared.<span>&nbsp; </span>If
            protocol is not followed, we retain the right to suspend a Profile Page until new ownership has been
            verified and identification provided.<span>&nbsp; </span>We reserve the right
            to terminate our agreement if, in our sole discretion, we determine that the change of ownership of the
            Profile Page or of your business renders your Profile Page or business no longer eligible or suitable to be
            listed on the Website.<span>&nbsp; </span>We will comply with the provisions
            of clause 2.4 where this applies.</p>
        <p>When you close your Profile Page:</p>
        <p>we agree to ensure that all payments we determine to be owing to you have been paid before closing
            your Profile Page;&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span>you agree to ensure that negative balances are
            paid to us in full prior to closing your Profile Page and agree to remain liable to pay any valid requests
            for refunds and associated Refund Fees which are received following such closure.</p>
        <p>If your Profile Page goes into a negative balance, you agree:</p>
        <p>to pay the outstanding balance to us within 7 (seven) days of going into the negative balance. If
            the debt is not settled within 7 (seven) days of going into negative balance, we may terminate our Agreement
            with you and we may instruct a third party to collect the debt;</p>
        <p>that we may withhold future payments to offset against the outstanding debt or pay at a later date
            once the debt has been settled, whichever arises first;</p>
        <p>that, we retain the right to suspend your Profile Page immediately if your account goes into a
            negative balance. Your Profile Page will not be reactivated until your negative balance has been paid, or we
            have reached an agreement with you in writing for its repayment.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><strong>Profile Page content and presentation</strong></p>
        <p>You agree to:</p>

        <p>comply with reasonable instructions from us concerning your Profile Page.</p>

            your Practitioner Information nor any of your activities or use of the Website (including your use of your
            Profile Page), will:</p>

        <p>You agree:</p>
        <p>to state clearly on the relevant Service Page the termination provisions applicable to the

        <p>not to include within your Profile Page, on a Service Page, on the DashBoard, in any other place

        <ul>
            <li>any direct or indirect link to other websites including your own website;</li>
            <li>your email address; or</li>
            <li>any other means by which a Customer could communicate directly with you, other than through
                the Dashboard. <span>&nbsp;</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the event that a Customer contacts you directly, you agree to direct the Customer to the
            Website and that we may invoice you for the applicable Commission Fee.</p>
        <p>You may amend and update information about your Practitioner Services displayed on the Website and
            you are responsible for designing, creating, managing and amending any bespoke graphics or product images in
            accordance with the applicable Policies.</p>
        <p><strong>Services Information</strong></p>
        <p>You agree to accurately display availability for all Practitioner Services and to update such
            availability regularly using the applicable options on the Dashboard.</p>
        <p>You agree to remove Practitioner Services from your Profile Page that are unavailable for
            prolonged periods (four weeks or more) until they become available again.</p>
        <p>If a Customer places an order for a Practitioner Service which is in fact unavailable and has not
            been displayed as such and the Customer consequently requires a refund, then we may charge you the
            Commission Fee on that order.</p>
        <p><strong>Pricing and VAT</strong></p>
        <p>Your prices must be fully inclusive of all taxes and additional charges.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>If you are VAT registered, you agree to set the VAT rate at the appropriate level which is
            currently applicable with respect to your Practitioner Services.</p>
        <p>You are solely responsible for ensuring that you fully comply with your current VAT registrations

        <p>If you fail to comply with clause 4.9.1, we may suspend your membership and you may have to pay a
            further Subscription Fee, if applicable and as detailed in clause 13.4 of these Conditions, or such other
            amount as may be notified to you from time to time. We will retain sole discretion as to whether to accept
            your request for re-activation.</p>
        <p>The Service allows you to offer your Practitioner Services on the Website as part of a detailed
            electronic online catalogue containing categories and sub-categories, so that you may display each
            Practitioner Service in the single most appropriate category, and with Practitioner Service information,
            pictures and promotions uploaded by you.</p>
        <p>You may apply for a Practitioner Service to be featured in one or more online catalogue
            categories, and we will retain absolute discretion as to which category is the most appropriate for a given
            Practitioner Service.</p>
        <p>You will ensure that each of your Practitioner Services listings contains all the information
            required by a Customer to make a purchase, and that such information is wholly accurate.<span>&nbsp;</span>
        </p>
        <p>You will not use keyword spamming (the use or placement of inappropriate keywords in a title or
            description to gain attention or divert users to another page) or similar techniques in Practitioner Service
            listings.</p>
        <p><strong>Compliance with our instructions and applicable laws<span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p>You agree to comply at all times with our reasonable instructions and all applicable laws and

        <p>all applicable bribery legislation.</p>
        <p>Where required by applicable laws and regulations, appropriate instructions will be included with
            on the relevant Service Page to ensure the safe enjoyment of the Practitioner Service by the Customer.</p>
        <p>You agree to inform us as soon as possible upon becoming aware of any claim against us or you
            arising out of or in connection with any defect in your Practitioner Services, or any failure by you to
            ensure that the Practitioner Services are appropriately provided in accordance with applicable laws or
            regulations or professional standards.</p>
        <p>You will compensate us in full for any and all liabilities, costs, expenses, fines, damages and

            clause 4.10.3 or paid or agreed to be paid by us in settlement of the claim and all legal or other expenses
            incurred by us in or about the defence or settlement of the claim. Loss or damage is foreseeable if either
            it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time the Agreement was entered into, both parties knew it
            might happen, for example, if you discussed it with us beforehand. We will notify you in writing as soon as
            possible after becoming aware of the claim.</p>
        <p>You agree to comply with our reasonable instructions and provide us with reasonable information
            and assistance in connection with any claim envisaged under clause 4.10.3.</p>

            provisions of this clause 4.</p>
        <p>Orders and your relationship with the Customer <span>&nbsp;</span>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Contract formation</strong></p>
        <p>You acknowledge and agree that following acceptance of an order through the Dashboard, such an
            acceptance is also deemed to be an irreversible instruction to us to conclude a contract of sale between the
            Practitioner and the Customer.<span>&nbsp; </span>Once given, this instruction
            cannot be reversed. The contract of sale between you and us is concluded when we (acting as your commercial
            agent) send an order confirmation email to the Customer, and we have no responsibility for the performance
            of any such contract.</p>
        <p>You acknowledge and agree that the terms and conditions relating to any such contract will
            comprise the Customer Terms, the email confirmation relating to the Customer's order and the applicable
            details on the relevant Practitioner Service page. You agree to be bound by all such provisions.</p>
        <p><strong>Notification of Customer Orders</strong></p>
        <p>We will notify you by email of any order awaiting your acceptance. You acknowledge that we do not
            promise the reliability of email communications and you must check the Dashboard daily for alerts of new
            orders.</p>
        <p>You will use your best efforts to accept and fulfil every order.</p>
        <p>Following notification of an order through the Dashboard, you agree to:</p>
        <p>fulfil the Customer order in accordance with its terms, including but not limited to in respect of
            the date, time and location for the provision of the Practitioner Service; and</p>
        <p>comply with the Customer Terms in connection with the relevant order.</p>
        <p><strong>Communication with Customers<span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p>You agree to ensure that any and all correspondence with any Customer will:</p>
        <p>be solely for the purposes of managing and fulfilling a Customer order;</p>
        <p>be via the Dashboard or, if that is not possible, then at all times include a reference to us;</p>
        <p>not include any reference to your own website, email address, other correspondence address or any
            other promotion of services outside those offered through or by us; and</p>
        <p>be undertaken in accordance with the <a href="{{ route('privacy.policy') }}">Privacy Policy</a>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Any breach of clause 5.3.1 will constitute a significant breach of these Conditions for the
            purposes of clause 2.3.1 and, further, may constitute a breach of Data Protection Laws.</p>
        <p>You agree to respond to any Customer enquiries or Customer complaints promptly and courteously in
            the first instance within one Working Day and to advise us of any escalated unresolved Customer enquiries as
            soon as possible.</p>
        <p>Changes to orders, cancellations and refunds<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>Following receipt of a request for cancellation of an ordered Practitioner Service (directly or
            via the Cancellation Form), you agree to deal with the cancellation in accordance with the <a
                href="{{ route('terms.and.conditions.customers') }}">Customer Terms.</a>
        </p>
        <p>Your behaviour and conduct</p>
        <p>You agree to conduct yourself at all times in your relations with us and our staff, Customers and
            other Practitioners strictly in accordance with a guiding principle of respect and mutual cooperation. In no
            circumstances will any impolite or abusive communications via any public or private channel be tolerated and
            we reserve the right to immediately suspend your Profile Page and/or terminate the Agreement in the event of
            any breach by you of this clause.</p>
        <p>Your use of the Dashboard</p>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>

        </p>
        <p>access the Dashboard unlawfully, modify or make derivative works based on the Dashboard nor
            attempt to reverse engineer or access the Dashboard with the intention of creating a competitive product or

            acknowledge that damages may not provide an adequate remedy for a breach of this clause and that we will be
            entitled to seek other legal remedies to prevent the occurrence or continuance of any alleged breach of this
            clause.</p>
        <p>You agree that the Intellectual Property Rights in the Dashboard are owned exclusively by us and
            nothing in the Conditions will be deemed to confer any rights in the Dashboard to you.</p>
        <p>Intellectual property rights</p>
        <p><strong>Our Intellectual Property Rights</strong></p>
        <p>You recognise that the Intellectual Property Rights in the Wowness Club name, logo or branding are
            owned entirely by us, and agrees that you may only use the Wowness Club name, logo or branding on any

        </p>
        <p>Any Intellectual Property Rights created by us in the course of the performance of these
            Conditions or otherwise in the provision of the Wowness Club Service will remain our property.<span>&nbsp;
            </span>For the avoidance of doubt, you will retain all Intellectual

        <p>We grant you permission for the duration of the Term only to use any Software or Documentation for
            the sole purpose of accessing and using the Wowness Club Service. This permission doesn't prevent us or any
            other third parties we chose to grant permission to from using the Software or Documentation. You cannot
            transfer this permission to anyone else and we can terminate our permission at any time. Nothing in these
            Conditions will be deemed to have given you permission or any other right to use any of our other
            Intellectual Property Rights.</p>
        <p>Where photographs or images of your Practitioner Services are produced by us or our agents, any
            such images may not be used by you for any purpose other than for display on the Website or in printed
            material produced by us. We reserve the right to charge you a licence fee in respect of any use of such

        <p>You promise that:</p>

            Website, and/or that you possess a valid permission to use any and all such Intellectual Property Rights;
        </p>
        <p>the making of Practitioner Services available for sale on the Website, and consequent use of your
            Intellectual Property Rights by us as referred to in clause&nbsp;9.2.2 will not infringe any Intellectual
            Property Rights owned by any third party, and there is and will be no claim against us by any third party
            arising in relation to the use of such Intellectual Property Rights.</p>
        <p>You permit us to access and use any content, including photos, that appear on your Profile Page or
            in any other promotional material in our own editorial content or promotional activity relating to us, you,

        <p>You agree to compensate us in full for any and all damages, liabilities, costs, expenses and/or
            losses resulting from any breach of clause 9.2.1 in respect of any claim that the normal operation,
            possession or use of those Intellectual Property Rights by us infringes a third party's rights
            ("<strong>Intellectual Property Rights Infringement Claim</strong>").</p>
        <p>In the event of an Intellectual Property Rights Infringement Claim you will immediately make
            without any charge to us such alterations, modifications or adjustments to the Intellectual Property Rights
            as will be necessary to make them non-infringing.</p>
        <p>We will notify you as soon as possible if we become aware of any Intellectual Property Rights
            Infringement Claim by a third party.</p>
        <p>We will be entitled to take sole conduct of the defence to any claim or action in respect of any
            Intellectual Property Rights Infringement Claim and may settle or compromise such claim or action at our
            sole discretion.<span>&nbsp; </span>You agree to give us such assistance as we
            will reasonably require in respect of the conduct of such defence including with all court procedures and

        <p><strong>Use of your information</strong></p>
        <p>You grant to us permission to use, license, disclose and distribute any information (including

            Wowness Club Service and related purposes (including disclosing information to third-party service providers
            so that they can contact you directly about their products and/or services).<span>&nbsp; </span>This

            revoke or charge us money for during the term of this Agreement. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><strong>Survival on termination</strong></p>
        <p>This clause 9 will survive termination or expiry of the Agreement regardless of how it comes to an
            end.</p>
        <p>Data Protection</p>
        <p>We will both comply with all applicable requirements of the Data Protection Laws. This clause 10
            is in addition to, and does not relieve, remove or replace, your or our obligations under the Data
            Protection Laws.</p>
        <p>We both acknowledge that for the purposes of the Data Protection Laws, and pursuant to the
            <a href="{{ route('privacy.policy') }}">Privacy Policy</a> we are both independent controllers (where
            "<strong>controller</strong>" has the meaning as
            defined in the Data Protection Laws). You are free therefore to process such Personal Data relating to a
            Customer as you may access via the Dashboard when such Customer purchases a Practitioner Service from you
            through the Website. You may carry out the processing of Personal Data of such Customer solely to the
            extent, and for such period, as is necessary for the purposes of fulfilling the relevant order of the
            Practitioner Service by the Customer.
        </p>
        <p>Without affecting the general position set out in clause 10.1, we will ensure that we have all
            necessary rights and notices in place to enable the lawful transfer of the Personal Data to you for the
            duration and purposes of this Agreement.</p>
        <p>Without affecting the general position set out in clause 10.1, you will, in relation to any
            Personal Data processed in connection with the performance by you of your obligations under this Agreement:
        </p>
        <p>process that Personal Data only in accordance with the Data Protection Laws&nbsp;</p>
        <p>ensure that all personnel who have access to and/or process Personal Data are obliged to keep the
            Personal Data confidential;</p>
        <p>at our written direction, delete or return Personal Data and any copies of the Personal Data to
            the Customer on termination of the Agreement unless required by applicable law to store the Personal Data;
            and</p>
        <p>maintain complete and accurate records and information to demonstrate your compliance with this
            clause 10 and allow for audits by us or our designated auditor.</p>
        <p>We consent to you appointing such third-party processors of Personal Data as are required by you
            to fulfil your obligations under this Agreement.<span>&nbsp; </span>You
            confirm that you have entered or (as the case may be) will enter into a written agreement with the
            third-party processor which include terms which are substantially similar to those set out in this clause
            10. You agree to remain fully liable to us for all acts or omissions of any third-party processor you
            appoint in relation to this clause 10, and you will promptly give us a list of all such sub-processors if we
            ask.</p>
        <p>You agree to compensate us in full for any and all liabilities, costs, expenses, fines, damages
            and losses (including any foreseeable losses, as explained at clause 4.10.4 above) we incur in connection
            with any claim arising out of any breach by you of this clause&nbsp;10 including any legal or other expenses
            incurred by us in or about the defence or settlement of the claim. We will notify you in writing as soon as
            possible after becoming aware of the claim. This clause 10 will survive termination or expiry of the
            Agreement however it comes to an end.</p>
        <p>Data access</p>
        <p>In operating the Wowness Club Service, and providing services to Practitioners (including the
            services we provide to you), we collect and have access to the data that this generates. We collect and have
            access to data relating to orders, Practitioner personal data (including relating to you) as set out in the
            <a href="{{ route('privacy.policy') }}">Privacy Policy</a> and customer personal data as set out in the <a
                href="{{ route('privacy.policy') }}">Privacy Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>We use this data in a variety of ways and for various reasons, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li">managing and supporting you as a Practitioner;</li>
                <li">for analytical purposes, including using aggregated data in marketing, communications, and

                        <li">other operational purposes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You have access to certain data relating to you and your orders via the Dashboard. However, you do
            not have access to any other data, and we do not share data relating to you or your orders with any other
            sellers.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Marketing and promotions</p>
        <p>From time to time we may run promotions on all or part of the Website. Any such promotions will be
            separate, and in addition to, any promotions operated by you in your Profile Page, and may involve offering
            Customers discounted prices or other promotional activity relating to some or all Practitioner Services on
            the Website. We will, where relevant and applicable to you and/or your Practitioner Services, inform you of

        <p><strong>Breakdown of the Fees<span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p>The Fees comprise, as relevant and applicable:</p>
        <p>the Commission Fee;</p>
        <p>the Subscription Fee; and</p>
        <p>the Refund&nbsp;Fee.</p>
        <p><strong>Commission Fee</strong></p>
        <p>A Commission Fee is payable by you on the value of the total amount payable by a Customer in
            relation to a Practitioner Service sold through the Website by you. The Commission Fee is calculated as a
            percentage of the price payable for the Practitioner Service.</p>
        <p>The Commission Fee payable by you will be as notified to you by us in writing at the time of
            inviting you to participate in the Website and in the absence of notification to the contrary shall be 15%
            of the price payable for the Practitioner Service. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>We will refund monies received by us in respect of sold Practitioner Services that are
            subsequently cancelled by the Customer and authorised for refund by you using the designated Dashboard,
            subject to your payment of the Refund Fee, set out below.</p>
        <p><strong>Subscription Fees</strong></p>
        <p>We reserve the right to charge you a monthly or annual Subscription Fee upon providing you with 30
            days&rsquo; written notice.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            receiving enhanced Wowness Club Services.<span>&nbsp; </span>The amount of the
            Subscription Fee will be as notified to you by us in writing from time to time. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><strong>Refund Fees</strong></p>

            Website is refunded to the Customer. The Refund Fee is not refundable under any circumstances.</p>
        <p>The Refund Fee is 2.5% of the total amount refunded, or such other amount as we may notify to you
            from time to time.</p>
        <p><strong>How payment is made to you</strong></p>
        <p>As part of your appointing us as your commercial agent (as set out in these Conditions), you agree
            that we also act as your agent for the purpose of accepting, refunding and/or otherwise processing
            payment(s) related to the sale of Practitioner Services by you via the Website (or any other sales channel
            which we may offer to you from time to time). We do this via our Payment Provider.</p>
        <p>Both you and we acknowledge and agree that except as otherwise provided in these Conditions (and
            in acknowledgement that both parties are businesses), that the duties of an agent implied under the common
            law are expressly excluded. For the avoidance of doubt, we, acting as your commercial agent, are neither the
            buyer nor the seller of the Practitioner Services and are not a party to the contract of sale of
            Practitioner Services between you and the Customer.</p>
        <p>Payments for Practitioner Services will be made directly by a Customer to us (acting as your
            commercial agent and via our Payment Provider), following the relevant transaction being recorded on your
            designated Dashboard. You must check the Dashboard daily for alert of new orders. You agree that the
            Customer&rsquo;s obligation to pay you for Practitioner Services is satisfied when the Customer validly pays
            us for the applicable Practitioner Services using our Payment Provider. You further agree that you will not
            seek recourse (legal or otherwise) against a Customer or any third party (including, but not limited to any
            payment service provider or gateway) for payment for a Practitioner Service if the Customer has validly paid
            us in the manner referred to in this clause.</p>
        <p>Payment for Practitioner Services by Customers through the Website will be made through our
            Payment Provider.<span>&nbsp; </span>In order to receive payment for
            Practitioner Services, you will need to agree to our Payment Provider terms at <a
                href="{{ route('terms.and.conditions.practitioners') }}">STRIPE
                TERMS</a>.</p>
        <p>We agree to pay you for the relevant transaction less the Commission Fee within 5 days following
            completion of the relevant Practitioner Service.<span>&nbsp; </span>Unless we
            otherwise agree with you, any payments we make to you will be in pounds sterling.</p>
        <p>From time to time we may retain a portion of the payment due to you in order to provide for
            refunds due or expected to be due to a Customer in the ensuing period. If refunds exceed your sales in a
            particular period, any future payments will be used to clear your negative balance and the difference
            leftover will be paid when the next payment is due.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>You agree to provide such of your banking details as are required or requested by our Payment
            Provider, in order that payment may be processed to you in respect of any Practitioner Services sold.</p>
        <p>Confidentiality</p>
        <p>The parties agree that they will keep in confidence any Confidential Information and, except in
            accordance with these Conditions, will not disclose that Confidential Information to any person (other than
            their employees, professional advisers or suppliers who need to know the information) without the written
            consent of the other party. For the avoidance of doubt, you authorise us (including our employees, agents
            and contractors) to hold and process Practitioner Information.</p>
        <p>The obligations of confidentiality under the Conditions will not extend to any matter which either
            party can show:</p>
        <p>is in or has become part of the public domain, other than through a breach of the Conditions or
            other confidentiality obligations;</p>
        <p>was lawfully in the possession of the recipient before the disclosure under the Conditions took
            place;</p>
        <p>was independently disclosed to it by a third party entitled to disclose the same; or</p>
        <p>is required to be disclosed under any applicable law, or by order of a court or governmental body,
            or by authority of competent jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>The obligations of confidentiality under the Conditions will remain in effect for two (2) years
            after the termination or expiry of the Agreement, however it comes to an end.</p>
        <p>Exclusions and limitation of liability (please read this section carefully)</p>
        <p>Nothing in these Conditions excludes or limits our liability for death or personal injury caused
            by our negligence, for fraudulent misrepresentation, or any other liability that cannot be excluded by law.
        </p>
        <p>Subject to clause 15.1, our total liability to you if we fail to comply with the Agreement will be
            limited in aggregate to a maximum of &pound;10,000.</p>
        <p>Subject to clause 15.1, we will not be liable to you for any loss of profit or other economic
            loss, foreseeable losses (as explained at clause 4.10.4 above), costs, expenses or other claims for
            foreseeable compensation or loss or damage that arise in connection with the Conditions, or for any
            liability incurred by you to a Customer, or to any other person, whether arising from the provision of the
            Wowness Club Service or otherwise.</p>
        <p>General</p>
        <p>You will not be entitled to charge, subcontract or transfer this Agreement or any part of it
            without our prior written consent. For example, and this does not in any way constitute an exhaustive list,
            if you wish to subcontract your obligations under this Agreement to a third-party service provider, or you
            wish to sell all or part of your assets to a third party, our prior written consent will be required in
            order to do so. You must also comply with the requirements set out at clause 4.4.5 with respect to changes
            of ownership of your Profile Page or business.</p>
        <p>We may charge, subcontract or transfer this Agreement or any part of it to any person.</p>
        <p>No term of these Conditions will be enforceable by any third party (which includes for these
            purposes any third party: employee, officer, agent, representative or sub-contractor of either party).
            Nothing in this clause excludes our rights when acting as your payment agent.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to suspend or to cancel our obligations under these Conditions in whole or in
            part (without liability) if we are prevented from or delayed in the carrying on of our business and our
            obligations under the Conditions due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including acts of God,
            fire, flood, lightning, epidemic, pandemic, severe weather conditions, war, revolution, acts of terrorism,
            IT or internet outage, industrial disputes (whether of our own employees or others) or acts of local or
            central government (including the imposition of legal or regulatory restrictions). If any such event beyond
            our reasonable control continues for a continuous period of more than 30 days, we may give you notice in
            writing to terminate the Agreement.</p>
        <p>If either party does not make a claim in respect of any breach of the Conditions, or delays in
            enforcing any breach, this will not prevent the subsequent enforcement of that breach and the relevant party
            will not be deemed to have given up the right to enforce any subsequent breach of that or any other
            provision.</p>
        <p>If at any time any one or more of these Conditions (or any part of one or more of these
            Conditions) is held to be or becomes void or otherwise unenforceable, for any reason under any applicable
            law, the same will be deemed omitted from the Conditions and the validity and/or enforceability of the
            remaining provisions of the Conditions will not in any way be affected or impaired as a result of that
            omission.</p>
        <p>Notices given under the Conditions must be in writing and may be delivered by hand or by courier,
            or sent by prepaid first class or registered mail to, in our case, our registered address, or any
            alternative address we notify to you in accordance with this provision; and, in your case, the address which
            you provide on the Dashboard, or any alternative address you notify to us in accordance with this provision.
        </p>
        <p>Notices may be validly served by email provided that, to be effective, such email is sent to the
            email address most recently provided by the addressee to the sender of the relevant notice.</p>
        <p>Except as set out in these Conditions, our relationship (including our employees) to you will be
            that of independent contractor and nothing in the Conditions will render us (nor our personnel) as an
            employee, worker, any other form of agent, or partner of yours or of any Customer's. Except where an express
            provision in these Conditions states to the contrary or at our reasonable discretion, neither party will
            have any right or authority to, and will not do or say anything on behalf of the other party or bind the
            party in any way.</p>
        <p>The Agreement, and any documents referred to in it, constitute the entire agreement between us and
            supersede and extinguish all previous drafts, arrangements, understandings or agreements between us, whether
            written or oral, relating to the subject matter of the Agreement.</p>
        <p>Each party acknowledges that in entering into the Agreement it does not rely on, and will have no
            remedies in respect of, any representation or promise (whether made innocently or negligently) that is not
            set out in the Agreement. Each party agrees that its only liability in respect of those representations and
            promises that are set out in the Agreement (whether made innocently or negligently) will be for breach of
            contract.</p>
        <p>Nothing in this clause will limit or exclude any liability for fraud or fraudulent
            misrepresentation.</p>
        <p>The Agreement and any non-contractual obligations relating to or arising under these Conditions
            will be governed by English law, and the parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
            English courts in respect of any dispute relating to or arising under it.</p>
        <p><strong>Mediation</strong></p>
        <p>Mediation is a process where a neutral third party facilitates negotiations between the parties to
            a dispute to help them come to an outcome that they can all agree on. We work with the Centre for Effective
            Dispute Resolution ("<strong>CEDR</strong>"), who we are willing to engage with to attempt to reach an
            agreement with you on the settlement, out of court, of any disputes we may have with you arising out of the
            Agreement. Although mediation is a voluntary process, you and we both agree to engage in good faith
            throughout any mediation attempts, and to also do so in accordance with the CEDR Model Mediation Procedure.
        </p>
        <p>You and we both agree to notify the other in writing if one of us wishes to submit a dispute to
            mediation. Unless you and we agree otherwise within 14 (fourteen) days of that notice, the mediator will be
            nominated by CEDR. We will bear a reasonable proportion of the total costs of mediation. Any attempt to
            reach an agreement through mediation on the settlement of a dispute will not affect your or our right to
            initiate court proceedings at any time before, during or after the mediation process. Let us know if you
            need any further information of the functioning and effectiveness of mediation.</p>
